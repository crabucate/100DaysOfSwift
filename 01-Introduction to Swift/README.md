# Introduction to Swift (Days 1-12)

## Day 1 – variables, simple data types, and string interpolation

Giving some keywords: *variables, strings, integers, Multi-line strings, doubles, booleans, string interpolation, constants, type annotations*

## Day 2 – arrays, dictionaries, sets, and enums

I feel familiar with arrays and enums.

Interesting! **Sets** are like arrays, but *random order* and every item *unique*.
```swift
let colors = Set(["red", "green", "blue"])
```
Never used sets till now.

Oh, look at this exotic thing, a **tuple**!
```swift
var name = (first: "Taylor", last: "Swift")
```
Never used a tuple till now.

Ah, around the corner is a dictionary:
```swift
let heights = [
    "Taylor Swift": 1.78,
    "Ed Sheeran": 1.73
]
```
Only used a dictionary when returned by UIKit-Methods, like... can't remember. Default value possible.







## Day 3 – operators and conditions
## Day 4 – loops, loops, and more loops
## Day 5 – functions, parameters, and errors
## Day 6 – closures part one
## Day 7 – closures part two
## Day 8 – structs, properties, and methods
## Day 9 – access control, static properties, and laziness
## Day 10 – classes and inheritance
## Day 11 – protocols, extensions, and protocol extensions
